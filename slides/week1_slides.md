# Week 1 — JavaScript Basics & Mad-Lib

---

## Welcome
- Junior Ninjas — Week 1
- Instructor: [Name]
- Agenda: Variables, input/output, functions, mini-project: Mad-Lib (JS)

---

## Learning Goals
- Understand variables and types in JavaScript
- Use `prompt()`/`console.log()` or input via editor UI
- Build a small program that asks questions and prints a story

---

## What is JavaScript?
- Language of the web
- Runs in the browser and on the server (Node.js)
- We'll use JS for both frontend (Next.js) and backend-like tests

---

## Variables & Types
- Examples:
  - `let name = "Alex";` (string)
  - `let score = 10;` (number)
  - `let isReady = true;` (boolean)

---

## Input & Output
- In the browser: `prompt('What is your name?')` and `console.log()`
- In our runner tests, functions will return strings – use `module.exports` to export

---

## Mini-Project: Mad-Lib
- Ask 3 questions: name, color, animal
- Fill answers into a story string
- Show example implementation using `makeStory(inputs)`

---

## Starter Code Explanation
- `makeStory(inputs)` should use defaults when keys are missing
- Show example code and explain template literals

---

## Live Coding Activity
- Instructor live-codes `makeStory`
- Students copy into editor and run tests

---

## Debugging Tips
- Read error messages
- Use `console.log()` to inspect variables
- Make small changes and re-run tests

---

## Homework
- Complete `madlib.js` template
- Add two extra questions (adjective, place)
- Run `npm test` and fix failing tests

---

## Next Week Preview
- Conditionals & Loops — build "Guess the Number"

---

## Q&A / End
- How to submit: push file or upload to platform
- Due date reminder
